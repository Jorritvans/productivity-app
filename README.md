# Productivity App - Backend

The backend of Productivity App is a Django Rest Framework (DRF) API designed to support a comprehensive task management application. This API manages user authentication, task creation, task commenting, and user interactions like following/unfollowing other users.

### Portfolio Project - Django REST Framework Application

The purpose of this project was to create a secure, RESTful API using Django that provides CRUD operations for tasks, user authentication, and follow/unfollow functionalities for a task management platform.

## Link to Backend Application

The live backend API is hosted on Heroku:

## API Documentation

The Productivity App API provides endpoints to manage tasks, comments, user profiles, and user relationships. Below are the key endpoints:

- **Authentication Endpoints**:
  - `/api/auth/register/`: Register a new user
  - `/api/auth/login/`: User login to obtain access and refresh tokens
  - `/api/auth/logout/`: Log out and invalidate tokens
  - `/api/token/refresh/`: Refresh access token using a valid refresh token

- **Task Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/tasks/`: Retrieve a list of tasks
  - `POST /api/tasks/`: Create a new task
  - `PUT /api/tasks/<task_id>/`: Update a specific task
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/<task_id>/`: Delete a specific task

- **Comment Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/comments/?task=<task_id>`: Retrieve comments for a specific task
  - `POST /api/comments/`: Add a comment to a task
  - `PATCH /api/comments/<comment_id>/`: Update a comment
  - `DELETE /api/comments/<comment_id>/`: Delete a comment

- **User Follow/Unfollow Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/accounts/follow/<user_id>/`: Follow a user
  - `POST /api/accounts/unfollow/<user_id>/`: Unfollow a user
  - `GET /api/accounts/following/`: List users the current user is following

## Features

The backend offers comprehensive features to manage tasks and user interactions:

- **JWT Authentication**: User authentication is managed via JSON Web Tokens, ensuring secure access and token refresh functionality.
- **CRUD Operations for Tasks**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks with permissions applied to restrict modifications to task owners.
- **Follow/Unfollow Functionality**: Users can follow or unfollow each other to view and engage with tasks from followed users.
- **Commenting System**: Users can comment on tasks, with functionality for editing and deleting their own comments.
- **Secure Access Control**: Permissions ensure users can only edit and delete their own tasks and comments.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**:
  - Python
- **Framework**:
  - Django
  - Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL for production
  - SQLite for local development
- **Authentication**:
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access control
- **Deployment**:
  - Heroku for live deployment
- **Media Storage**:
  - Cloudinary for storing media files, ensuring scalable media management
- **Version Control**:
  - Git and GitHub for project tracking and version control

## Development & Structure

The backend is structured as a Django project with multiple Django apps that manage specific aspects of the API. Key apps include:

- **Accounts**: Handles user registration, profile management, and follow/unfollow functionality.
- **Tasks**: Manages all CRUD operations for tasks.
- **Comments**: Manages CRUD operations for task comments.

The application follows Djangoâ€™s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, with Django Rest Framework (DRF) used to create RESTful views. Serializers in DRF ensure that data from models is validated and converted to JSON format for easy consumption by the frontend.

## Data Models

- **User**: Custom user model linked to tasks and comments. Includes followers and following relationships for user engagement.
- **Task**: Stores task details, including title, description, priority, due date, category, and state.
- **Comment**: Each comment is linked to a task and a user, allowing users to interact on specific tasks.

## Security Features

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data, such as secret keys and database credentials, are securely managed with environment variables and are not committed to the codebase.
- **Token Expiration & Refresh**: Access tokens expire and are refreshed automatically, enhancing security for user sessions.
- **Permissions**: DRF permissions are used to restrict access, ensuring only authenticated users can create tasks and comments, and users can only modify their own content.

## Bugs

- **No known bugs** at the time of deployment.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Comprehensive manual testing was performed on API endpoints to verify correct functionality for all CRUD operations, authentication flows, and user interactions.

| Endpoint                      | Method | Description                                      | Status |
|-------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `/api/auth/register/`         | POST   | Registers a new user                             | Pass   |
| `/api/auth/login/`            | POST   | Logs in a user and returns tokens                | Pass   |
| `/api/tasks/`                 | GET    | Retrieves all tasks for the authenticated user   | Pass   |
| `/api/tasks/`                 | POST   | Creates a new task                               | Pass   |
| `/api/tasks/<task_id>/`       | PUT    | Updates a specific task                          | Pass   |
| `/api/tasks/<task_id>/`       | DELETE | Deletes a specific task                          | Pass   |
| `/api/comments/`              | POST   | Creates a new comment on a task                  | Pass   |
| `/api/accounts/follow/<user_id>/` | POST | Follow a user                                   | Pass   |
| `/api/accounts/unfollow/<user_id>/` | POST | Unfollow a user                               | Pass   |

### Validation

- **PEP8 Compliance**: All Python code was checked with PEP8 to ensure consistent formatting and adherence to style guidelines.
- **Testing Tools**: Postman was used to manually test API endpoints for expected responses and error handling.

### Deployment Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a new Heroku app and configure environment variables for secure credentials.
3. Configure PostgreSQL on Heroku.
4. Set the buildpacks to Python in Heroku.
5. Deploy the application.
